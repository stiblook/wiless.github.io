##  IMT-2020 Development - Part 2 (Dec 2019)

The recent meeting 10-13 Dec 2019 at Geneva was WP5D#33 and is an important milestone in the IMT2020 development process, where the WP5D concluded the  _Proposals IMT2020_  stage. Its christmas time in #Geneva. You can already see the lights prepared on the street.

In my previous [post](/articles/imt2020p1.html), which was based on the outcome of the WP5D meeting in June 2019 at Brazil. The importance of this meeting (#32) can be noted from this ITU’s IMT2020 development timeline. The conclusion of the process "Proposals IMT-2020" could not be completed for some of the submissions.

This meeting (#33) included a workshop, where the proponents and Independent evaluation groups were invited to present the submissions and evaluation results.

## Background

The proponents were expected to complete their submissions in WP5D#32 since WP5D#28 (about 20months). WP5D had received seven candidate technologies from six proponents. In the  _32nd meeting of WP5D_, the submissions from 3GPP, China and Korea had completed STEP 3 as per the ITU-R submission requirements. Additionally, it was also acknowledged that the four technologies were technically identical to 3GPP.

In the  _32nd meeting of WP5D_,

-   Submissions from 3GPP, China and Korea had completed STEP 3 as per the ITU-R submission requirements.
-   Additionally, it was also acknowledged that the four technologies were technically identical to 3GPP.
-   ETSI/DECT Forum (DECT2020-NR component) , Nufront and TSDSI do not yet permit WP 5D to determine if a complete and satisfactory self-evaluation as required by the IMT-2020 process has been fully provided, thus these submissions have not yet completed and did not complete the  _STEP 3_.
-   On exceptional basis, to facilitate these proposals having an opportunity to remedy their submissions and conclude Step 3 by at the 33rd meeting, proponents were expected to revise the necessary documents as per the IMT2020 requirements and submit by  10th Sept 2019.

These submissions were  _reviewed_  during the WP5D#33 meeting, where the proponents presented their final submission. Hence, this meeting was a milestone in the IMT2020 development cycle.

## WP5D#33 Outcome

As per the chairman’s report of the meeting ([5D/37](https://www.itu.int/md/R19-WP5D-C-0037/en)), these proponents met the obligations of the ‘_Way Forward_’ having provided improved submissions by  _10 September 2019_.

During the workshop, technical clarifications on the technologies, submission reports and queries posted on the “ITU-R Evaluation Discussion Area” and bilateral communications between IEGs and proponents were discussed.

Ten registered Independent Evaluation Groups presented their organization, evaluation methods, proposed technologies under evaluation, summary of interim evaluation reports submitted to WP 5D #33 meeting and so forth. There were observations and questions on the interim evaluation reports from proponents and other Independent Evaluation Groups. Some of the IEGs had posted questions to proponents (TSDSI and DECT) in the “[Evaluation Groups discussion area](https://extranet.itu.int/itu-r/imt2020-evalgroup/SitePages/Home.aspx)”.


### Presentations from Proponents

3GPP informed that they will be submitting both Rel.15 and Rel.16 in their specifications for RIT & SRIT

China & Korea confirmed again that their submissions TECHNICALLY identical to 3GPP submissions

**DECT Forum**

-   revised  _their self-evaluation report_  using the evaluation configurations as recommended by ITU-R
-   _revision addressed_  the technical observations raised during WP5D#33 meeting
-   _submission_  contains the 3GPP NR and DECT-NR components, the 3GPP NR component is  _technically identical_  to 3GPP for meeting the performance requirements for eMBB scenarios and endorsed the 3GPP Self-evaluation report
-   _mMTC_  and  _URLLC_  scenarios were evaluated using the DECT NR component
-   self-evaluation report had additional evaluation results with evaluation configurations  _not part of the ITU-R recommendations_

**TSDSI**

-   _informed_  that the revised self-evaluation report is based on 3GPP features (i.e. no additional changes in the TSDSI-RIT) was used during the evaluation
-   _informed_  that their revised submission replaced the NB-IoT technology component with  _modifications_  over 3GPP LTE Rel.15 NB-IoT specifications. The earlier submission in WP5D#33 had modifications over 3GPP LTE Rel.14 NB-IoT specifications
-   _informed_ that the technical performance results in their self-evaluation report will be similar to self evaluation of 3GPP NR (Rel.15) and 3GPP NB-IoT (Rel.15), though their submission is  _not technically identical_  to 3GPP due to the modifications in both NR and NB-IoT specifications

**NuFront (EUHT)**

-   OFDM based TDD only system, with subcarrier spacing 19.53KHz, 39.0625KHz, 78.125KHz, 390.625 kHz (for mmWave) ( unlike 3GPP NR)
-   Single technology component for all the scenarios - eMBB, mMTC and URLLC
-   Supports  _variable frame length_  from 0.1ms to 14ms ( unlike 3GPP NR)
-   _revision_  includes updates in the Characteristic templates, Compliance templates and Self-evaluation report
-   specifications are completely different than existing, deployed cellular IMT technologies 3GPP LTE and NR

## Step 3 – Submission/reception of the RIT and SRIT proposals and acknowledgement of receipt

> The submission of each candidate RIT or SRIT must include completed templates (these templates are provided in Report ITU-R_ [_M.2411-0_](https://www.itu.int/pub/R-REP-M.2411-2017)_, together with any additional inputs which the proponent may consider relevant to the evaluation._

> Each proposal must indicate the version of the minimum technical performance requirements and evaluation criteria of the IMT-2020 currently in force that it is intended for and make reference to the associated requirements._

> The entity that proposes a candidate RIT or SRIT to the ITU-R (the proponent) shall include with it either an initial self-evaluation or the proponents’ endorsement of an initial evaluation submitted by another entity. The submission will not be considered complete without an initial self-evaluation or the proponents’ endorsement of an initial evaluation submitted by another entity._

Based on the description of Step 3,  **all the candidates were considered to clear STEP 3**  of the IMT2020 process

## Next Step

> Step 4 – Evaluation of candidate RITs or SRITs by independent evaluation groups

-   _Candidate RITs or SRITs will be evaluated._
-   _The evaluation reports from Independent Evaluation Groups will be considered in the development of the ITU-R Recommendation describing the radio interface specifications._
-   _In this step the candidate RITs or SRITs will be assessed based on Report ITU-R_ [_M.2411-0_](https://www.itu.int/pub/R-REP-M.2411-2017) _._
-   _If necessary, additional evaluation methodologies may be developed by each independent evaluation group to complement the evaluation guidelines in Report ITU-R_ [_M.2411-0_](https://www.itu.int/pub/R-REP-M.2411-2017)_. Any such additional methodology should be shared between independent evaluation groups and sent to the BR for information to facilitate consideration of the evaluation results by ITU-R._
-   _Coordination between independent evaluation groups is strongly encouraged to facilitate comparison and consistency of results, to assist ITU-R in developing an understanding of differences in evaluation results achieved by the independent evaluation groups and to form some preliminary consensus on the evaluation results._

**_Next meeting is scheduled between 19-26 Feb 2020 at Geneva._**

The conclusion from the next meeting (#34) will give a better understanding of these candidate technologies which have been independently assessed.
