# Story of the Official 5G

<img class="ui fluid image" src="/imgs/genevalake.jpg">


*Official 5G* - The technology recognized and recommended by ITU-R to be deployed in IMT spectrum bands, that has been
built to meet the requirments of new generation. Once in every 10 years, ITU-R meets to identify new requirements and
vision of next generation of IMT technology. IMT-2000, IMT-Advanced (2010), IMT-2020 (2020) and next will be in 2030!.

Among all the generations of mobile technology, #5G has made lot of momentum and expectations from the technology right
from the day when it was chalked out on a whiteboard. 



## 3GPP 5G initiatives

3GPP is the only standardization body which had actively started developing specifications in 2015 that can deliver the
wish-list of the IMT-2020. 3GPP technologies 2G,3G,4G have been widely adopted by all cellular operators in all
countries. 3GPP kick starts its 5G standards development by the landmark RAN 5G workshop -”Start of Something” in Sept
2015 in USA. The workshop summary is available in [2]. More than 550 members participated with 70 presentations !!.
Major operators, equipment manufacturers contributed in the workshop.
Suprisingly no companies or organization from India contributed to this workshop !!

There is one more wirelesss technology that we use in our day-to-day life - WiFi a standard developed by IEEE. WiFi is
based on 802.11 series (802.11a/b/g/n/ac) specifications. WiFi technology dont fall under the category of IMT (lack
cellular mobility support). IEEE had developed WiMAX (802.16m) which supported mobility and is also an IMT-Advanced
(official 4G) technology. WiMAX lost market adoption and failed to become a global cellular technology.


## Did IEEE develop 5G too ??

IEEE 802 standards group formed formed a standing committee IEEE 802 EC 5G / IMT-2020 standing committee to assess (by
July 2016)[4]:

- Costs and benefits of creating an IEEE 5G specification
- Costs and benefits of providing a proposal for IMT2020

<blockquote>
  Finally, IEEE decided NOT to develop and submit a IEEE based 5G candidate technology to ITU-R
  IEEE being such a large member driven body did a good homework before spending time to develop specifications for
  IMT2020 requirements !!</blockquote>

<h2>2014</h2>
The journey of official 5G began in 2014 and completed the vision of IMT and overall objectives of the future development of IMT for 2020 and beyond (see report M.2483) in Sept 2015. This ITU-R recommendation was based on inputs various administrations, standards body and members of ITU.

        meetings in 2018 to propose 802.11ax as complimentary solution for some of the environment like Indoor
        Hotspot and Dense Urban. IEEE and 3GPP exchanged LS to participate together for the ITU-R submission. In May
        2019, NuFront proposed a joint candidate technology (IEEE 802.11ax and EUHT) submission to ITU-R. (See [16])
