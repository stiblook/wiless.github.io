## See the same in golang 


# Session 3
## Introduction
In this session the following things will be programmed :
1. Making a list
2. Using the pop command
3. Using the append command 
## Step
1.  Open Visual Code
2. Open a new file
3. Save it with extension '.py' 
4. Type the following into the file
 
```python
list = [apple, banana, orange]
print("The list is ", list)
a = strawberry
list.append(a)
print(a)
list.pop(2)
print(list)
```
## What is done in code
'print()' function is called and the string in it is displayed
### Thanks. I hope you learned something new.â˜º 
 

is this working ?
$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$


``` golang
func fromMarkDown(mdstr []byte) []byte {
	// newstr := blackfriday.MarkdownCommon(str)

	htmlstr := blackfriday.MarkdownCommon(mdstr)
	fmt.Printf("OUTPUT %s", htmlstr)
	return htmlstr

}
```

wow this work ? \\[ x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a} \\]


# Next line is simple

`$$x^2=3` 

``` math
x^2+y^2=z

```


Hope you can see the code ??
